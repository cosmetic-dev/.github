### We help your company build, deploy, secure, and scale applications in the cloud and on the edge.

You will never hear us use buzzwords like ‚Äúsupercharge‚Äù or ‚Äúnext generation‚Äù. We simply build reliable applications that run in modern cloud and edge compute environments using proven technologies like Go, and forward-thinking tools like WebAssembly and eBPF.

We **guarantee** our work will result in a team, codebase, build/deploy pipeline, security posture, and scaling capability that is second to none, and we‚Äôll help you maintain it after you outgrow us.

We offer our services to startups, established teams, large enterprises, and non-profits. We specialize in creating new projects from scratch quickly, and helping you hire and train a team to meet your goals. Only in special cases will we join existing projects or work on legacy systems.

**For startups**, we offer a 6-month program that will start your product off on the right foot, and hire your engineering team so that we can phase ourselves out. We also offer ‚Äúconsulting CTO‚Äù services to help manage your team.

**For larger teams, enterprises, and non-profits**, we have a wide range of services to offer from backend system development, DevOps, engineering management, architecture design, and more. Let us help get your new project started the right way.

Finally, we build and operate the `Cosmetic Toolkit`, a set of libraries, tools, infrastructure, and reference architectures that help us build high quality products for you. Only our clients get access to the full toolkit, and they retain access forever.

Our company is designed to **be small and stay small**. We only take on a very small number of clients at a time. Though any client has access to our advice and assistance in perpetuity, our main goal is to hire and train a team that will make ourselves obsolete.

You can get in touch and we will reply within 1 business day.
